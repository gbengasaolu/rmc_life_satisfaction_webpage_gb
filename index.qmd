### Happiness across the world over time

The World Happiness Report is a well-known source of cross-country data on self-reported life satisfaction, collected by the Gallup World Poll. The visualizations below present the ‘happiness scores’ for each country.

The main life evaluation question asked in the poll is the Cantril Life Ladder question:

> “Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?”

::: {.panel-tabset}

## 🔢 Table

**Average self-reported life satisfaction** – Cantril Ladder score (0=worst; 10=best)

```{r}
# In this tab, you will create a table similar to the one on the Our World in Data page.
# The table should have the following columns:
# Country, `2011`, `2023`, Absolute change, and Relative change.

# You should:
# 1. Use `select` to drop the Code column from the `cantril` data as it is not needed in the table.
# 2. Filter the `cantril` data frame to just the years 2011 and 2023.
# 3. Use the `pivot_wider` function to create the columns for 2011 and 2023.
# (You may need backticks around column names with spaces or which start with numbers.)
# 4. Use the `mutate` function to calculate the Absolute change and Relative change.
# 5. Also with `mutate`, you should round your numbers to appropriate decimal places.
# 6. Then use scales::percent to format the Relative change as a percentage.
# 7. Use the `reactable` function to create and output the table.

reactable(cantril_table)


```


## 🌎 Map

The map plots the average answer that survey respondents provided to this question in different countries. As with the steps of the ladder, values in the map range from 0 to 10.

```{r}
# This code is already done for you. You don't need to change anything here. If you change any of the column names, or something else with the data, you may need to adjust the code below.
# Create choropleth map
cantril %>%
    mutate(`Cantril ladder score` = round(`Cantril ladder score`, 2)) %>%
    plotly::plot_geo(width = 940) %>%
    add_trace(
        z = ~`Cantril ladder score`,
        color = ~`Cantril ladder score`,
        locations = ~Code,
        text = ~Country,
        frame = ~Year, colors = "YlGn"
    ) %>%
    colorbar(
        title = "Ladder Score",
        limits = c(min(cantril$`Cantril ladder score`), max(cantril$`Cantril ladder score`)),
        tickvals = seq(0, 10, by = 2),
        ticktext = seq(0, 10, by = 2)
    )
```


## 📈 Simple Chart

```{r}
# In this tab, create a simple line chart of the Cantril score over time for a few countries,
# similar to the one on the Our World in Data page.
# Note that your chart will not have the ability to filter countries like the one on the Our World in Data page.

# You should:
# 1. Filter the cantril data to just 4 to 8 countries you want to highlight
# 2. Use ggplot to create a line chart of the Cantril score over time, with different colors for each country
# 3. Use geom_line to create the lines
# 4. Use scale_y_continuous to set the y-axis limits to 0 and 10.
# 5. Use labs to create neat labels for the chart
# 6. Use theme_minimal to set the theme.
# 7. Finally, use ggplotly to convert the ggplot chart to a plotly chart

# (When you're done with this section, don't forget to add tabsets, as mentioned in the instructions.)

# 1. Filter the data to 4–8 countries you want to highlight
cantril_mini <- cantril %>%
  filter(Country %in% c("Australia", "Austria", "Botswana", "Brazil", "Brunei"))

# 2. Create the ggplot line chart
cantril_linechart <- cantril_mini %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = `Cantril ladder score`, color = Country)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.2) +    # 3. Use geom_line for lines
  geom_point(size = 2) +     # Optional: add points
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 10)) +    # 4. Set y-axis from 0 to 10
  labs(
    title = "Trends in Cantril Ladder Scores (Selected Countries)",  # 5. Neat labels
    x = "Year",
    y = "Cantril Ladder Score",
    color = "Country"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()             # 6. Set clean minimal theme

# 7. Make it interactive with ggplotly
   ggplotly(cantril_linechart)



```

## 📈 Advanced Chart

One problem with the simple chart on the previous tab is that the countries are fixed. It would be better if the user could select the countries they want to see. This is not possible with `plotly` alone, but with the `crosstalk` package and some custom JavaScript, we can achieve this, as demonstrated below.

This is simply a demonstration for you, you do not need to work on this for your assignment. You may want to come back to this when you need such functionality in your own projects.

For more information on how we achieved this, see [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67058016/how-to-set-default-values-in-filter-select-in-crosstalk-in-r-plotly).


```{r}
pacman::p_load(crosstalk, plotly)

# Crosstalk shared data object
# This allows the filter to interact with the plot
shared_cantril_data <- highlight_key(cantril)

cantril_plotly <- plot_ly(
    shared_cantril_data,
    x = ~Year,
    y = ~`Cantril ladder score`,
    color = ~Country,
    type = "scatter",
    mode = "lines+markers"
) %>%
    layout(yaxis = list(range = c(0, 10)))


country_filter <- filter_select(
    "country_filter",
    "Select a country to examine",
    shared_cantril_data,
    ~Country,
    multiple = TRUE
)

# Output the filter and the plot
bscols(
    list(country_filter, cantril_plotly)
)

# Note that the default countries will only be set when you knit the document.
# Because it relies on the javascript snippet below, which is not rendered in the quarto preview.
```

<!-- CUSTOM JAVASCRIPT TO SET DEFAULT VALUES IN THE FILTER: -->
<script>
function filter_default() {
  var default_countries = ["Norway", "Australia", "Germany", "Bolivia", "Colombia", "Bhutan"]; // Set default countries here
  document.getElementById("country_filter").getElementsByClassName("selectized")[0].selectize.setValue(default_countries, false);
}
window.onload = filter_default;
</script>

## 📈 Happiness Rank

```{r}
# OPTIONAL CHALLENGE SECTION:

# Add a final tab with a single figure that shows the top 10 and bottom 10 countries by happiness score in 2023. Remember to add a ## header and include it in the tabsets

# 1. Filter 2023 data only
happiness_2023 <- cantril %>%
  filter(Year == 2023) %>%
  arrange(desc(`Cantril ladder score`)) 

# 2. Top 10 happiest
top10 <- happiness_2023 %>%
  slice_head(n = 10)

# 3. Bottom 10 least happy
bottom10 <- happiness_2023 %>%
  slice_tail(n = 10)

# 4. Plotting
top10_plot <- top10 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(Country, `Cantril ladder score`), y = `Cantril ladder score`, fill = Country)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Top 10 Happiest Countries (2023)",
    x = NULL,
    y = "Cantril Ladder Score"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
ggplotly (top10_plot)

bottom10_plot <- bottom10 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(Country, `Cantril ladder score`), y = `Cantril ladder score`, fill = Country)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Bottom 10 Least Happy Countries (2023)",
    x = NULL,
    y = "Cantril Ladder Score"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
 ggplotly (bottom10_plot)

```
